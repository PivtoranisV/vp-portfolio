          Once upon a time, in the picturesque town of Lviv in western Ukraine,
          I discovered my deep-rooted love for technology. It all began when I
          laid my hands on my first PC, and from that moment, I was captivated
          by the world of programming.

          During my university years, I even took on part-time jobs setting up
          computers, fueling my passion for the digital realm. After completing
          my studies, I embarked on a career in the banking industry. However, a
          burning desire to build my own house propelled me to seek new
          opportunities abroad.

          That&apos;s when I made the life-changing decision to move to Dubai, a
          vibrant city filled with endless possibilities. I initially found my
          place in the retail sector, but my heart yearned for something more,
          something that would truly allow me to immerse myself in the world of
          technology. Fortune smiled upon me when I landed a job at Apple, one
          of the most renowned companies in the world. Though I wasn&apos;t
          directly involved in programming at that time, I found myself
          surrounded by innovation and an unwavering passion for technology.
